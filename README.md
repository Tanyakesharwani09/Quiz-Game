🚀 ##How It Works

The quiz data is stored in a JavaScript array of objects.

Each question is dynamically loaded into the DOM using innerHTML.

Users select an option, and visual feedback shows whether the selected answer was correct.

Score is tracked and updated in real-time.

After completing all questions, the final score is displayed.

The game can be restarted with a simple reload.
